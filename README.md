# LinkedIn Job Application Automation

## Description
This project is a Python script that automates the process of applying for jobs on LinkedIn. The script first opens the LinkedIn website and clicks on the "Jobs" tab. It then searches for jobs with the specified keywords and location. Once a job is found, the script clicks on the "Apply" button and fills out the application form. The script can also enter the applicant's phone number.

## To use the script, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
Selenium
ChromeDriver
You will also need to create a LinkedIn account and save your login credentials in the ACCOUNT_EMAIL and ACCOUNT_PASSWORD variables.

To run the script, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, run the following command:

- python LinkedIn_Job_Application_Automation.py
The script will then start applying for jobs.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any problems running the script, you can try the following:

- Make sure that you have installed the latest versions of the Selenium and ChromeDriver libraries.
- Check your internet connection.
- Try using a different browser.
- Clear your browser's cache and cookies.
- Try disabling any extensions or add-ons that you are using.
- If you are still having trouble, you can post a question on the Selenium forum: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users.
